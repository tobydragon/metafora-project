Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example,
if ``a == 7`` then ``7 == a``. But in Python, the statement ``a = 7``
is legal and ``7 = a`` is not. (Can you explain why?)

   :answer_b: true
   :answer_c: True

   :feedback_a: &quot;True&quot; is a String, not a Boolean.
   :feedback_b: true with a lowercase t is not a reserved word in Python, not a Boolean.
   :feedback_c: True is a Boolean value.
   :feedback_d: false with a lowercase f is not a reserved word in Python, not a Boolean.
   :feedback_e: False is a Boolean value.

.. mchoice:: test_question2_1_2
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: True
   :answer_b: 3 == 4
   :answer_c: 3 + 4
   :answer_d: 3 + 4 == 7
   :answer_e: &quot;False&quot;
   :correct: a,b,d
   :feedback_a: True and False are both Boolean literals.
   :feedback_b: The comparison between two numbers via == results in either True or False (in this case False),  both Boolean values.
   :feedback_c:  3 + 4 evaluates to 7, which is a number, not a Boolean value.
   :feedback_d: 3 + 4 evaluates to 7.  7 == 7 then evaluates to True, which is a Boolean value.
   :feedback_e: With the double quotes surrounding it, False is interpreted as a string, not a Boolean value.  If the quotes had not been included, False alone is in fact a Boolean value.

.. mchoice:: test_question2_1_3
   :multiple_answers:
   :answer_a: 6 <= 9
   :answer_b: True == &quot;True&quot;
   :answer_c: &quot;False&quot; != False
   :answer_d: 7 == 4
   :answer_e: 9 + 6 == 15 
   :correct: a,c,e
   :feedback_a: This evaluates to True 6 is certainly less than or equal to 9.
   :feedback_b: This evaluates to False. The Boolean value: True, is not equal to the String value: &quot;True&quot;.
   :feedback_c: This evaluates to True. The String value: &quot;False&quot;, does not equal the Boolean value: False. But the expression evaluates whether or not these two items are NOT equal. Because they are not equal, this evaluates to True.
   :feedback_d: This evaluates to False because 7 does not equal 4.
   :feedback_e: This evaluates to True because the sum of 9 and 6 is equal to 15.

.. mchoice:: test_question2_1_4
   :answer_a: when comparing Strings to see if they are equal
   :answer_b: when assessing whether a number is greater than another number
   :answer_c: when assigning a number to a variable
   :answer_d: when comparing the value of two variables
   :correct: c
   :feedback_a: You should use a Boolean expression to evaluate whether two Strings are equal.
   :feedback_b: You should use a Boolean expression to evaluate whether a number is greater than another number.
   :feedback_c: Boolean expressions are not used for assignment. One equal sign ( = ) is used for assignment and two equal signs ( == ) are used for comparison.
   :feedback_d: You should use a Boolean expression to compare two variables

   When would you NOT use a Boolean expression?
